						<h3>Hidetaka Doen</h3>
						<p>Nice to meet you!Born and raised in Osaka, I'm a proud Kansai native. I'm currently studying in the Department of Information Engineering at Kwansei Gakuin University in Sanda, Hyogo Prefecture. My research focuses on network architecture, conducted within Professor Hiroyuki Ohsaki's laboratory.From elementary through high school, I was dedicated to track and field. My specialties were sprinting and throwing; not only did I run, but in middle school, I threw the discus, and in high school, the javelin. Since university, I've taken up archery. It seems like the distance I can send objects just keeps getting longer!</p>

						<p>I'm also a member of the university's archery club, where I constantly refine my focus and mental fortitude. As the 66th Vice Captain, I supported the captain and led the team. I started archery in my first year of university. Despite the absence of a dedicated coach at my school, I actively sought guidance from seniors, archers from other universities, and even Olympic athletes. Thanks to this, over my four years at university, I've competed in various national tournaments, including the National Sports Festival, All Japan Championships, and the Collegiate Archery National Championship (Oza Ketteisen). Archery has taught me invaluable lessons in building human relationships and the importance of continuous effort towards a goal.</p>

						<p>Among my achievements, in my second year, the Kwansei Gakuin University men's team advanced to the Collegiate Archery National Championship for the first time in 58 years, where we competed as school representatives and finished in 6th place. In my third year, I represented Osaka in the National Sports Festival (Japan Games) and placed 7th. Additionally, I've competed in individual events at the All Japan Student Championships and the All Japan Championships. I believe these accomplishments were not only due to my persistent efforts towards my goals but also because I was fortunate to be surrounded by supportive people.</p>

						<p>f I were to describe myself in one sentence, it would be: "I actively take on challenges and spare no effort." Let me elaborate on this statement.</p>
						
						<p><u>1. Actively Taking on Challenges</u><br>To achieve my objectives and foster personal growth, I proactively embrace new things. For instance, a current challenge involves writing a research paper and presenting it at an academic conference, all within three months of joining my laboratory. While I do feel concerns about potential failure or embarrassment, my desire to explore the full extent of my capabilities and dedication outweighs these fears, driving me to tackle everything with enthusiasm.ã€‚</p>

						<p><u>2. Sparing No Effort</u><br>Throughout my life, I've consistently built up efforts little by little. My achievements in sports club activities and academics are the result of daily practice and diligent study. While shortcuts to goals might exist, I'd rather spend my time moving forward bit by bit while searching for them, rather than standing still. I now feel that this steady accumulation of effort has been particularly well-suited to programming.</p>
